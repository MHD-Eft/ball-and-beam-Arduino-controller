# ball-and-beam-Arduino-controller
Ball and Beam Controller project with Arduino â€“ without PID

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a ball-and-beam balancing system using Arduino UNO and a servo motor.
The system uses manual control logic to maintain the ball's position on the beam â€” PID control is not yet implemented but planned for future updates.
The goal is to explore control system fundamentals in a hands-on way, with minimal hardware requirements.

ðŸ§© Features:
Real-time analog position sensing via potentiometer

Basic logic for ball stabilization

Modular code structure for easy PID integration in the future
